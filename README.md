### Configuration 

You can find the configuration file in following locations:  
| OS              | Location          
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows         | `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Zotify\config.json`          |
| MacOS           | `/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/ApplicationSupport/Zotify/config.json` |
| Linux           | `/home/<USERNAME>/.config/zotify/config.json`                     |

To log out, just remove the configuration file. Uninstalling Zotify does not remove the config file.

### Output format

With the option `OUTPUT` (or the commandline parameter `--output`) you can specify the output location and format.  
The value is relative to the `ROOT_PATH`/`ROOT_PODCAST_PATH` directory and can contain the following placeholder:

| Placeholder     | Description
|-----------------|--------------------------------
| {artist}        | The song artist
| {album}         | The song album
| {song_name}     | The song name
| {release_year}  | The song release year
| {disc_number}   | The disc number
| {track_number}  | The track_number
| {id}            | The song id
| {track_id}      | The track id
| {ext}           | The file extension
| {album_id}      | (only when downloading albums) ID of the album
| {album_num}     | (only when downloading albums) Incrementing track number
| {playlist}      | (only when downloading playlists) Name of the playlist 
| {playlist_num}  | (only when downloading playlists) Incrementing track number

Example values could be:
~~~~
{playlist}/{artist} - {song_name}.{ext}
{playlist}/{playlist_num} - {artist} - {song_name}.{ext}
{artist} - {song_name}.{ext}
{artist}/{album}/{album_num} - {artist} - {song_name}.{ext}
~~~~

### Docker Usage
```
Build the docker image from the Dockerfile:
  docker build -t zotify .
Create and run a container from the image:
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/Zotify Music:/root/Music/Zotify Music" -v "$PWD/Zotify Podcasts:/root/Music/Zotify Podcasts" -it zotify
```

### What do I do if I see "Your session has been terminated"?

If you see this, don't worry! Just try logging back in. If you see the incorrect username or password error, reset your password and you should be able to log back in.


### Will my account get banned if I use this tool?

Currently no user has reported their account getting banned after using Zotify.

It is recommended you use Zotify with a burner account.
Alternatively, there is a configuration option labeled ```DOWNLOAD_REAL_TIME```, this limits the download speed to the duration of the song being downloaded thus appearing less suspicious.
This option is much slower and is only recommended for premium users who wish to download songs in 320kbps without buying premium on a burner account.
